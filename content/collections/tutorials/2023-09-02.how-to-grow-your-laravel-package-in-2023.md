          PHPUnit
          PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

And while I love the attention to detail Sebastian has put into his work over the last 21 years. But his GitHub page does not scream "Here is why PHPUnit will fix your problem and how you should use it". There is no real call to action that makes you want to start learning or downloading it. '

But do note that writing documentation is part of releasing a package if you want others to use it. If not for them, write it for yourself because in my experience code written 6 months ago is like new code. Code that you first have to understand. '
