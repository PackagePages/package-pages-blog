      statamic is the CMS package if you love customability and if you want to have full control over what the output and inputs of your blog posts/articles look like. It is perfect for that and with its great documentation and even an full course on laracasts it great package that you should check out. 

      It is even free, until you want to scale it up to multiple user accounts / more features you will have to pay a price + a subscription after a year.

    listicle_markdown: 'While Till is a little bit older than Statamic it has not gained as quite a following. It is still worth considering though. Its documentation is a great place to start. With it upcoming version 3 in beta as of writing (2022) the future of Twill seems to be bright!'
