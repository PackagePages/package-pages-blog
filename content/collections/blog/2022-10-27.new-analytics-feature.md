<div class="text-left pt-8">
    <p class="pt-8">
        We are very excited to announce our new Analytics feature.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-8">
        The analytics page gives you an overview of your sites statistics. Including your packagist and github data. 
        This data is gathered using both the packagist api and github api.
        <ul class="mt-4 list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
               total downloads. 
            </li>
            <li>
                downloads per project. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Github open issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                Github stars.
            </li>
            <li>
                Github watchers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Github forks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        See an example page below.

    <p class="pt-8">
        While the total stats are nice to see, you might want to view your individual stats per site. 
        This is also possible! As seen as below.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-8">
        In the future the analytics page will also contain:
        <ul class="mt-4 list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
                Analytics on the amount of requests to your unique site url. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Analytics on the downloads of your project over time. 
            </li>
            <li>
                And more!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="pt-8">
        We are very happy with the result and would love to hear your feedback. Contact us via twitter
