<div class="text-left pt-8">
    <p class="pt-8">
        We are very excited to announce our new Analytics feature.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-8">
        The analytics page gives you an overview of your site's statistics.
        Including your packagist and GitHub data.
        This data is gathered using both the packagist API and GitHub API.
        <ul class="mt-4 list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
                Total downloads.
            </li>
            <li>
                Downloads per project.
            </li>
            <li>
                GitHub open issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                GitHub stars.
            </li>
            <li>
                GitHub watchers.
            </li>
            <li>
                GitHub forks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        See an example page below.

    <p class="pt-8">
        While the total stats are nice to see, you might want to view your stats per site. 
        This is also possible! As seen below.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/stats-show.png">
    <p class="pt-8">
        In the future the analytics page will also contain:
        <ul class="mt-4 list-disc ml-5">
            <li>
                Analytics on the number of requests to your unique site URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                Analytics on the downloads of your project over time.
            </li>
            <li>
                And more!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="pt-8">
        We are very happy with the result and would love to hear your feedback. Contact us via Twitter
